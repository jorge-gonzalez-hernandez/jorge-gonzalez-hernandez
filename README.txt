IMPORTANT NOTE: add restaurant does not support adding a restaurant with the same name as
			an existing restaurant.

STEPS TO RUN:
	- *in folder where server.js exists*
	- npm init
	- npm install express
	- npm install pug
	- node server.js

- The html is from three pug templates: addrestaurant.pug, singleRestaurant.pug, restaurants.pug

Additions:
    - The server creates a JSON file when adding a restaurant
	thus, reads from "./restaurants/" directory for a list of restaurants
